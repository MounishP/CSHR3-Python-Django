Problem Statement: Online Shopping System

You are tasked with developing an online shopping system that allows users to browse products,
add them to a shopping cart, and place orders. The system should support different types of products,
such as electronics, clothing, and books.

Requirements:

1. Define a base class Product that represents a generic product.
It should have attributes such as name, price, and quantity.

2. Implement subclasses for different types of products, such as Electronics, Clothing, and Books.
Each subclass should inherit from the Product class and include additional attributes and methods
specific to the product type.

3. Implement a class ShoppingCart that allows users to add products, remove products, view the total price,
and place orders. It should utilize inheritance to inherit common functionality from a base class.

4. Implement a class User that represents a user of the online shopping system.
It should have attributes such as name, email, and address.

5. Extend the User class to create subclasses for different types of users, such as Customer and Admin.
Each subclass should inherit from the User class and include additional attributes and methods specific to
the user type.

6. Implement appropriate methods for displaying information about products, users, and orders.

Tasks:

1. Design a class hierarchy for the online shopping system, incorporating inheritance, encapsulation, and
polymorphism.

2. Implement the classes based on the defined class hierarchy.
3. Create sample instances of products, users, and shopping carts to test the functionality of the system.
4. Ensure that the system handles different types of products and users correctly, providing appropriate
functionality and behavior for each.

Additional Considerations:

Handle edge cases and error conditions gracefully.
Implement validation for user input and data integrity.
Optimize the system for performance and scalability.
Provide clear documentation and comments to explain the purpose and usage of each class and method.
