"""
A group of football fans decided to buy tickets for Euro Cup. The tickets are sold in two price categories:
VIP – 499.99$.
Normal – 249.99$.
The football fans have a shared budget, and the number of people in the group determines what percentage of the budget
will be spent on transportation:
1 to 4 – 75% of the budget.
5 to 9 – 60% of the budget.
10 to 24 – 50% of the budget.
25 to 49 – 40% of the budget.
50 or more – 25% of the budget.
Write a program that calculates whether the money left in the budget will be enough for the football fans
to buy tickets in the selected category, as well as how much money they will have left or be insufficient.
