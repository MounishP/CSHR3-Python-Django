    1. Identity Operators in List

Github

Day 1:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Variables -> name which holds a value

Datatypes:
type() -> function where it will give you the datatype
Numeric
    Integer -> +,-,0
    Float -> decimal
Text type
    String -> enclosed inside "", the value inside "" can be anything
Boolean type
    True (1)
    False (0)
Sequence Types:
    list -> [] -> editable
    tuple -> () -> cannot be editable
Mapping Type:
    Dictionary -> key:value
None:
    Nothing

Operators:
    1. Arithmetic Operators -> +,-,*,/
        // -> floor division
        % -> modulus
        ** -> exponentiation

    Floor division

    3/2 -> 1.5
    3//2 -> 1

    modulus -> reminder
    13%5 -> 3
    3%2 -> 1

    2)3(1                          5)13(2              45)12(0
      2                              10                    0
      --                            ----                  ---
      1    -> reminder                3                    12

    2. Comparison Operator
    = -> equal    -> assigning
    == -> equals -> comparing
    comparison operator the output is always boolean

    >,<,==,>=,!=,<=

    3. Logical Operator -> Boolean
    AND   -> x and y
    OR
    NOT

    4. Assignment Operators
    = -> assigning


Conditional Statements:

1. Simple If
    Syntax:

    if condition:
        statements
        statements
        statements

2. if...else statements

    if condition:
        statements
        statements
        statements
    else:
        statements
        statements
        statements

input function -> input()

3. elif statement -> else if

    if condition:
        block of code
    elif condition:
        block of code
    else:
        block of code

    1. for every if you can have only one else
    2. you can have multiple elif's

4. if else ladder

Loops in Python:

    1. For loop
    2. While loop

For Loop:
    Syntax:

        for item in list:
            action  -> block of code

    range(start,stop-1) -> range(1,100) -> [1,2,3,...99]

    Break(stop) & Continue(Skip):

While Loop:
    A 'while' loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true.

    Syntax:
        while condition:
            block of code

List:
    A list is a mutable, ordered collection of elements. Elements can be of different datatypes and
    can be modified, added and removed.
    List is enclosed in big brackets  [].

Tuple:
    A list is a immutable, ordered collection of elements. Elements can be of different datatypes and
    cannot be modified, added and removed.

Dictionary:
    key - pair
    key must be unique
    {}


pip install turtle

Python Functions:
    built-in function    -> print(),type(),int(),input()
    user defined function -> user created

    1. function definition
    2. function call

    def funcName():
        block of code

Uses:
    1. Reuse the code
    2. Code readability

Parameterised function

Class in Python:
-------------------
Class is a template for creating objects
Object is the instance of the class

Syntax:
    class NAME:
        -----
        -----

When ever you create a object for a class init is called automatically.

Diff Function & method?
    Function and method both are same
    its called a method only when its inside a class
